# High Performance Control

This repository is for the high performance control algorithms that are being researched by students at QUT (under the supervision of Jason Ford). The code base is C++, but also has some MATLAB counterparts.

### Installation / Getting started

To install the high performance control in first run the following command:
```markdown
git clone https://github.com/revolutionized/High-Performance-Control.git High-Performance-Control
cd High-Performance-Control
```
Then follow the User Manual to install all dependencies. Then for Windows you can run:
```markdown 
Install_Windows.bat
```
Or for MacOS / Linux:
```markdown
. Install_Linux.sh
```

### Acknowledgements

Refer to UserManual.pdf for the full installation manual. But the required components / dependencies are:
- [C3 Library](https://github.com/goroda/Compressed-Continuous-Computation)
- [CDYN Library](https://github.com/goroda/cdyn)
- [C3SC Library](https://github.com/goroda/c3sc)

Without these components this project really wouldn't exist! Additional third party libraries used are:
- [Tclap Library](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/)

### Contributing

Please open a Github issue to ask a question, report a bug, or to request ownership (if you are taking over this project). To contribute, just fork the repository and develop from there.
